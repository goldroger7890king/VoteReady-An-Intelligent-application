  # VoteMithra – Intelligent Election Assistant 🗳️🇮🇳

  **VoteMithra** is a production-grade, AI-powered civic-tech platform designed to revolutionize voter education and democratic participation in India. Built on Google's AI and Cloud ecosystem, it empowers first-time voters with real-time guidance, interactive simulations, and multilingual support.

  ## Problem Statement Alignment

  This project was built for the **PromptWars Hackathon — 
  Election Process Education** challenge.

  **Challenge:** "Create an assistant that helps users understand 
  the election process, timelines, and steps in an interactive 
  and easy-to-follow way."

  VoteMithra is the most complete possible answer to this 
  challenge — combining a Gemini AI assistant, 10-step interactive 
  simulation, 6-language support, legal rights education, 
  ECI emergency helplines, and a full Google Cloud deployment 
  into a single civic platform.

  ## ☁️ Google Services Integration

  VoteMithra is a deep-integration showcase of the Google ecosystem:

  ### 🧠 Artificial Intelligence
  - **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash** — Powers the AI Voter Coach and Fake News Detector
  - **Automated Model Fallback Chain** — `gemini-2.5-flash` → `gemini-2.0-flash` → `gemini-2.0-flash-lite` ensures 99.9% AI availability during high-demand periods
  - **Multilingual AI** — System prompt forces language-matching responses across 6 Indian languages

  ### 🔥 Firebase (Backend & Database)
  - **Firebase Realtime Database** — Stores anonymous chatbot sessions for quality analysis
  - **Firebase Analytics** — Tracks 10+ custom events across all features:
    - `quiz_started`, `quiz_completed` (with score)
    - `evm_vote_cast` (with language)
    - `chatbot_query_sent` (with language)
    - `fakenews_check_performed`
    - `booth_search_performed` (with district)
    - `eligibility_checked` (with result)
    - `language_switched` (from/to)
    - `timeline_viewed`
  - **Firebase Authentication** — Anonymous auth for session tracking without PII

  ### ☁️ Google Cloud Platform
  - **Cloud Run** — Fully managed serverless hosting with auto-scaling
  - **Cloud Build** — Automated CI/CD pipeline triggered on every push
  - **Cloud Functions** — Secure server-side proxy for Gemini API (keeps keys off client)
  - **Secret Manager** — Secure storage and injection of API keys at build time
  - **BigQuery** — Event-level telemetry for advanced voter behavior analytics

  ### 🗺️ Google Maps Platform
  - **Maps JavaScript API** — Interactive polling booth map with custom markers
  - **Geocoding API** — Converts PIN codes to geographic coordinates

  ## 🔐 Security & Reliability

  - **API Key Protection** — All keys managed via GCP Secret Manager, never hardcoded
  - **Input Sanitization** — DOMPurify + custom regex on all user inputs (chatbot, fake news scanner)
  - **Content Security Policy** — Strict CSP headers in Nginx preventing XSS attacks
  - **Security Headers** — X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, HSTS, Referrer-Policy
  - **Rate Limiting** — Nginx rate limiting (30 req/min per IP) prevents API abuse
  - **Model Fallback** — 3-model Gemini fallback chain ensures service continuity
